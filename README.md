# Refactoring Code using Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
### By analyzing two years of green stocks data, I was able to practice writing and refactoring VBA code.  I created for loops to find the total daily volume and yearly return rate for mulitple stocks.  I also used VBA to format this data into a user friendly output worksheet.  The user will now have access to tabulated data regarding the green stocks in fractions of a second.  
## Results
